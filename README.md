# Car Evaluation Classifier Comparison

## Overview

This project compares the performance of two classification algorithms—**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (implemented from scratch) and **Decision Trees** (using library support)—on the **Car Evaluation Dataset**. The goal is to determine which algorithm better predicts car acceptability based on categorical features.

## Objectives

* Implement **KNN from scratch** and compare its performance against:
  * **Scikit-learn KNN**
  * **Scikit-learn Decision Tree**

* Evaluate each model on:
  * **Accuracy**
  * **Precision**
  * **Recall**
  * **F1-score**
  * **Training/Prediction time**
  * **Model interpretability**

## Outcome

This comparative analysis will help identify:

* How a handcrafted KNN fares against a library-optimized version
* The trade-offs between simplicity (KNN) and interpretability (Decision Trees)
* The most suitable approach for categorical classification in resource-constrained or explainability-sensitive settings
