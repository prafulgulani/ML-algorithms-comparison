# Car Evaluation Classifier Comparison

This project compares the performance of two classification algorithms—**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (implemented from scratch) and **Decision Trees** (using library support)—on the **Car Evaluation Dataset**. The goal is to determine which algorithm better predicts car acceptability based on categorical features.

Additionally, this project includes a direct comparison between the **custom KNN implementation** and **scikit-learn's KNN**, to analyze differences in:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Computational efficiency
